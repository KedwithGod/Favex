üìñ Overview

This guide explains how to set up, run, and debug your Flutter application. It covers environment setup, dependencies, building the app, and additional notes for development and testing.

Tip: Follow each step carefully to avoid common setup issues.

‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Ensure your system has the following installed:

Flutter SDK (stable channel recommended)

Dart SDK (included with Flutter)

Android Studio or VS Code (for IDE support)

Xcode (for iOS development on macOS)

Git (for cloning the repository)

Note: Make sure your Flutter installation is complete and added to your PATH. Run flutter doctor to check for missing dependencies.

üõ†Ô∏è Setup Steps
1. Clone the Repository

Clone your Flutter project and navigate into the project folder:

Tip: Use a descriptive folder name to avoid confusion with other projects.

2. Install Dependencies

Fetch all required Flutter and Dart packages:

flutter pub get


Note: This installs packages listed in pubspec.yaml.

3. Configure Environment

If your application uses environment variables or .env files (via flutter_dotenv or similar):

Copy the example .env file if available

Update API keys, endpoints, or other environment-specific settings

Tip: Do not commit sensitive keys to version control. Use a .gitignore file for .env.

4. Run the Application

Run the application on your desired platform:

Android: Connect an Android device or start an emulator

iOS: Connect an iPhone or start a simulator

Web: Run in the browser

Command:

flutter run


Tip: Use flutter run -d <device_id> to specify a device if multiple are available.

5. Build the Application

Generate platform-specific builds for deployment:

Android APK:

flutter build apk


iOS App:

flutter build ios


Web Build:

flutter build web


Note: Make sure you have the required platform SDKs installed (Android Studio for Android, Xcode for iOS).

üêû Debugging

Flutter comes with built-in debugging tools:

Hot Reload / Hot Restart: Quickly apply code changes

Flutter DevTools: Inspect UI, performance, and network requests

Logging: Use debugPrint for console logs

Tip: Use flutter run --verbose to see detailed logs for troubleshooting.
